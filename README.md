# Nubank - Bank operationg test

This development was proposed by Nubank as a challenge to code a process of bank operations.

During the interview I have noticed that the Clojure is the language more used by the company. So I decided to learn and implement the requirements request on this language.

I have implemented all requirements as it was requested. But I have confess I have had some difficulty to set my mind to code in Clojure.The mission is now done. :)
